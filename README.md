# esx_ati  

This scripts is a vehicle inventory which you can store all item you put in the config.   

**HOW THIS WORK**  
Go right in front of your trunk.
Press U to open the trunk. This will then start an animation and then open the trunk.  
The inventory ui will then open and you can store item in the trunk.  
When finish press backspace to close the trunk and the animation will stop and then close the trunk.       

**IMPORTANT**  
Make sure to add any item you would like to stay saved in the trunk during a server restart. If said item is not listed in the config.   Those item **WILL** disapear from inventory and lost forever.  
I have provide a good list. It's up to you to remove or comment those you don't have and to add those who arent there.  

**HOW TO INSTALL**  
Put resource in your server.  
Install the sql file.  
Add ```start esx_ati``` to your server config.  
HAVE FUN.
